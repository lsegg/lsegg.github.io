## Available Scripts ‚öô

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start:` Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm test:` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
- `npm run build:` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
- `npm run deploy:` GitHub Pages will automatically detect that a new commit has been added to the gh-pages branch of the GitHub repository. Once it detects that, it will begin serving the files that make up that commit ‚Äî in this case, the distributable version of the React app
